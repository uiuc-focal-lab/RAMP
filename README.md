## Code

### Installation
We recommend first creating a conda environment using the provided [requirements.txt](https://github.com/uiuc-focal-lab/RAMP/blob/main/requirements.txt):

`conda create --name RAMP --file requirements.txt`

### Training from Scratch

+ **Main Result**: The files `RAMP.py` and `RAMP_wide_resnet.py` allow us to train ResNet-18 and WideReset models with standard choices of epsilons. To reproduce the results in the paper, one can run `RAMP_scratch_cifar10.sh` in the `scripts/cifar10` folder.
  
+ **Varying Epsilon Values**: We provide scripts of `run_ramp_diff_eps_scratch.sh` (RAMP), `run_max_diff_eps_scratch.sh` (MAX), and `run_eat_diff_eps_scratch.sh` (E-AT) in folder `scripts/cifar10` for running the training from scratch experiments with different choices of epsilons. 

### Robust Fine-tuning

+ To get pre-trained versions of ResNet-18 models with different epsilon values, one can run `pretrain_diff_eps_Lp.sh` scripts in folder `scripts/cifar10`.

+ It is also possible to use models from the [Model Zoo](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench#model-zoo) of [RobustBench](https://robustbench.github.io/)
with `--model_name=RB_{}` inserting the identifier of the classifier from the Model Zoo (these are automatically downloaded). (credits to E-AT paper)

+ **Main Result**:  To reproduce the results in the paper with different model architectures, one can run `RAMP_finetune_cifar10.sh` in folder `scripts/cifar10` and `RAMP_finetune_imagenet.sh` in folder `scripts/imagenet`.

+ **Varying Epsilon Values**: We provide the scripts `run_ramp_diff_eps_finetune.sh` (RAMP), `run_max_diff_eps_finetune.sh` (MAX), and `run_eat_diff_eps_finetune.sh` (E-AT) in the folder `scripts/cifar10` for running robust fine-tuning experiments with different choices of epsilons. 

### Evaluation (from E-AT paper)
With `--final_eval` our standard evaluation (with APGD-CE and APGD-T, for 10 restarts of 100 steps) is run for all threat models at the end of training.
Specifying `--eval_freq=k` a fast evaluation is run on test and training points every `k` epochs.

To evaluate a trained model one can run `eval.py` with `--model_name` as above for the pre-trained model or `--model_name=/path/to/checkpoint/` for new or fine-tuned
classifiers. The corresponding architecture is loaded if the run has the automatically generated name. More details about the options for evaluation in `eval.py`.
